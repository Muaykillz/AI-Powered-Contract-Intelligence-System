      "gt_answer": "The RGHI-RCP Transition Services Agreement includes important confidentiality provisions. As stated in Section 7.4 of the contract, both parties are required to protect the other party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care they use to protect their own confidential information, but not less than reasonable care. The agreement specifies that neither party shall use the other party's Confidential Information other than to perform Services pursuant to this Agreement. Additionally, the contract outlines exceptions to confidentiality obligations, such as information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party or information independently developed by the receiving party.",
      "response": "{'answer': 'The key provisions regarding confidentiality in the RGHI-RCP Transition Services Agreement can be found in Section 11. According to this section, both parties acknowledge that they may obtain Confidential Information from each other in the course of performing duties under the Agreement. Confidential Information is defined as information that is disclosed to one party by the other except as expressly permitted in the Agreement. Each party agrees to use the Confidential Information of the other party solely to the extent necessary to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under the Agreement and not for any other purpose. Each party also agrees to disclose such Confidential Information only to its employees, agents, and contractors with a need to know such Confidential Information and who have obligations of confidentiality not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as expressly permitted hereunder. Furthermore, each party agrees not to disclose to any third party or use any Confidential Information for any purpose except as expressly permitted in the Agreement. The parties also acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the other party for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and the other party shall therefore be entitled to seek timely injunctive relief to protect its rights under this Section 11, in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or in equity. The terms and conditions of the Agreement will be deemed to be the Confidential Information of each party and will not be disclosed without the written consent of the other party.', 'contexts': [{'file_name': 'Ediets Co-Branding Agreement.pdf', 'page': '5', 'document': 'Women.com Networks, Inc. and eDiets.com, Inc.
